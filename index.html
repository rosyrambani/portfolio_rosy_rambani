                        I've got chops in all phases of the design process. I love collaborating with brilliant people across disciplines to create unique, immersive, visual and shareable interactive experiences for mobile, desktop and tablet.
                        
                            I collaborate with clients and peers to nurture and transform ideas into well thought out design specs. After all, that's where the majority of amazing user experiences start.
                            I sketch and wireframe interfaces focusing on content structure, intuitive UI patterns and simple interactions. I'm a minimalist who truly believes that less is more.
                        I design in the browser with HTML(5), CSS(3) and JavaScript. I love coding things from scratch, but I have worked largely with front-end frameworks like Bootstrap too.</p>

                        <br><br>
                        I have spent the last two years working as a freelance web developer and designer and as part of a team in various companies like Venus Mind Media and Elementary Creative as a Full Stack Web Developer. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as the ability to communicate with team members and clients while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.<br><br>
                        As a web developer and designer I worked on several projects in Canada and India.
                            I have worked on a multitude of web and print based projects for a range of clients providing Web Design and Development (PHP, HTML, CSS, LESS, JavaScript, jQuery, WordPress, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts), eCommerce Solutions, Corporate Branding and Graphic Design. My eye for detail, creative view on the world, and meticulous nature have left me with many highly satisfied team members. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My work is fully responsive, and tested in a wide range of devices. I take great care to ensure each project is well-documented and easily maintainable.
                            Often front-end development of a website is overlooked, but being the part of your project that combines design, back-end development and the layer that your users interact with, from my experience, it is the most important to get right.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        
                            In my past experience as a freelancer and working for companies I have also obtained an eye for detail and appreciation for design, knowledge of integrating with and developing server-side, as well as knowing how to efficiently project manage and work with clients and colleagues successfully.
                            
                            Cross browser compatibility is ensured by using feature detection so older browsers still in use today provide a solid experience, whilst modern browsers can go the next step and enhance a user’s time spent on the site.
                            Writing semantic markup that is documented and easy to read means it can be maintained and scaled in the future, and allows co-workers to quickly work with it.
                            
                            <br>
